# Dronez

This is the central repository for the "Dronez" project, an introductory experiment conducted over the summer of 2021 to familiarize the team with the Crazyflie quadrotor drone and Bitcraze' provided `cflib` and `cfclient`.

The objective of this experiment is twofold:

- To set up and configure the on-site drone lab
- To achieve operably sufficient familiarity with the resources available in preparation for more complex future applications
